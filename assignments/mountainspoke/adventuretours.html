    <h1>20K In A Day:</h1>
    
   <p>Our biggest one day tour EVER!<br><br>

In the spirit of more is better and you can’t have enough fun, The Mountain Spoke has put together the Everlasting Gobstopper of one day rides: 20K in a day. Why? Because the trails are there and we like riding trails, all day. This is a full day. We’ll leave at “Oh my gawd it’s early” and finish at tired:30. Of course lunch, guides and shuttles are included. This is not for the faint of heart.  Advanced riders only. Due to the extreme (for you and our resources) nature of the 20K there's a minimum of 7 riders.<br><br>
